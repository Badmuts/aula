_**Aula** — A microservice oriented webservice exploring the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) landscape_

## Goals

* **Microservices**: Implement a webservice using a microservice architecture
* **Containerized**: Every service should be able to run within its own container.
* **Cloud Native**: Try to incorporate useful tooling from the CNCF project.
* **Serverless**: Explore how serverless and a microservice architecture work together.
* **Learn**: Explore latest techniques, tools from the Cloud Native Foundation and industry and have fun doing so.

## Getting started
Recommend way is to use the provided docker environment:

```sh
# setup env
$ make configure
# start app
$ docker-compose up
```

This repo is exploring the monorepo paradigm. To facilitate this [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is used. Getting started should be as simple as running `npm install`:

```sh
$ npm install
# start app
$ npm start
```

> **Note:** This method requires you to setup your own environment

## Packages
* 🌍 [base-server](packages/base-server)
* 🔐 [crypto](packages/crypto)

## Services
* 🔑 [auth](services/auth)
* 📓 [course](services/course)
* 🕵️‍♂️ [search](services/search)

## Release
Releasing a new version can be done via the `make release` command. This command will ask you for
a version tag or fallback to `branchname-commithash`. After the build images will be pushed to the
hub.

```sh
# Build and push images
$ make release
QUEST:   Version tag?:[master-87265e6] -> 1.0.0
INFO:    Starting build for version 1.0.0
...
```
